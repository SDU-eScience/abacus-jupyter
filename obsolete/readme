HOW TO USE JUPYTER ON ABACUS 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tool will help you access an instance of Jupyter notebook, running on a
node on Abacus, from your local browser. The following steps will explain how
to get it working.


----------------------------------------
STEP 1: CONNECT TO ABACUS
----------------------------------------
From your local machine, use the following command to connect to the frontend:

ssh -L 8888:localhost:<PORT> <USER>@fe.deic.sdu.dk


----------------------------------------
STEP 2: START JUPYTER
----------------------------------------
To start an instance of Jupyter using Python 3.6, use the following command:

jpt start

This will submit a job to the SLURM queue using your group's default account,
but you can specify another account using:

jpt start <account>

You can also start Jupyter using Python 2.7 by issuing the command:

jpt start2


----------------------------------------
STEP 3: CONNECTING TO JUPYTER
----------------------------------------
After Jupyter has been submitted to the queue, you can show the current status
with the command:

jpt status

Once the job is running, you need to connect to the running Jupyter instance
using the command:

jpt connect


----------------------------------------
STEP 4: ACCESS JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
----------------------------------------
After completing the above steps, you should be able to access Jupyter from
your local browser using the following URL address:

http://localhost:8888

For security reasons, you will need a token to access the notebook. The token
can be obtained with the command:

jpt token


----------------------------------------
STEP 5: STOPPING JUPYTER
----------------------------------------
By default the Jupyter job will terminate after 6 hours. However, you can stop
your instance of Jupyter with the command:

jpt stop
